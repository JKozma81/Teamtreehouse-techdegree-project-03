# My Teamtreehouse techdegree project 3

Third project in the Teamtreehouse Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree

Used technologies: HTML/CSS/JavaScript(ES6)/jQuery

In this project the goal was to demonstrate our jQuery DOM Manipulation knowledge, by creating an interactive form with self written front-end validation.

The HTML and CSS files are provided by Treehouse, but the JS file is self writen.
